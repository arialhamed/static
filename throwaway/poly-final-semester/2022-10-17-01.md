# First day of my final semester

<span class="timestamp">[12:51]</span> alright alright alright, so imagine going into Advanced Topics in AI, the teacher said there's nothing advanced about it, and we learn Jupyter & Markdown instead.

You know, 2 things that I have done before, doing markdown for months on end.

and right about now the lecturer said "we can stop here", then said something about saving the world so that we must stop the models & when we don't need to use it.

first day isn't done but damn it's already good.
